# Python Number Guessing Game 🎮

A lightweight, terminal-based game where the user tries to guess a randomly generated number.

## ⚙️ How It Works
The program follows a simple logic loop to provide a smooth user experience:



1. **Initialization**: The computer selects a random number.
2. **Input**: The player enters a guess.
3. **Validation**: The script checks if the input is a valid integer.
4. **Comparison**: The script tells the player if the guess is too high, too low, or correct.
5. **Termination**: The loop ends when the player guesses correctly.
